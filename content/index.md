## Thank You for Putting Kids First!

I appreciate the trust that the voters of Zone 4 placed in me in 2023, and I will strive to do everything I can to exceed your expectations.  I expect to run again in November of 2027, and as that date approaches I will provide updates on my campaign here.

Until then, feel free to call/text me on my personal cell phone at 208.713.4599 and I'll do my best to return your message as quickly as possible.

Dave Binetti
Trustee, West Ada School District
Zone 4 (Eagle, Star and portions of Meridian, Boise, and Garden City)
